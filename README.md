takeover
========

Board game designed by a 7 year old. The idea of Takeover is to "take over" your opponent's village (corner square) with your warriors while preventing the same happening to your village.

Takeover is played on an 8x8 game board, like chess or checkers, with the "lower right" square from the perspective of each opponent serving as the village. Each player is allocated three warriors that initially are placed in the squares adjacent to the village. A "coin flip" determines which player moves first, after which they will alternate. In each turn, a player rolls a die to determine how many moves are available. The player can then choose a warrior to move that number of squares up, down, left, or right (warriors may not move diagonally or back into a space already visited during that turn). If a warrior lands on a square containing another warrior, then the warrior already present on the square is considered "defeated" and should be removed from play. 

The game ends when one player lands a warrior on the other player's village.

Takeover runs in Python and requires a reasonably modern version of Pygame.
